# Brief Description
Majority of IT labs in today's academic institutions face operational issues in the management
of multiple systems simultaneously. The concept of automation has existed for several years, but they
typically just consisted of performing small tasks such as switching the appliances on/off
automatically. In this automation project, we try to implement both the Laboratory as well as IT
automation services together as a package. The IT automation tasks include many services
such as automatic installation and uninstallation of several softwares whenever needed through in a centralized environment using Ansible framework. To keep track of access records of the systems, we would also be designing a web-based GUI which records and displays the access information of PCs too. Thus a well thought out design for automating these various operational tasks inside the IT lab environments has been implemented and worked upon.
